        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Dublin Web Summit is too big!!! Fact..</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">November 11, 2014 by <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/michaeljdonoghue/">Michael</a></p>
<p>
So is this a fact? Is Web Summit too big?
</p><p>
In short, yes I think so!!
</p><p>
Why?  Simple really.  The value for the startups on show is minimal.  With so many startusp (2000 over three days) it is very difficult to get noticed and the coverage that they need to justify the expense, espeicially since teams had come from all over the world.  Most people I spoke to over the week agreed that the conference was actually too large and that the value for startups is low.  The only winners at Web Summit were the large corporate sponsors who were able to bring a large number of people and engage with a large number of starutps and attendees, there are the ones that won so to speak!
</p><p>
That being said, it was fun. What a week.  22,000 attendees from the global startup ecosystem descended on Dublin this week and tore it up :)
</p><p>
With the conference and after parties the week was certainly exhausting and a certainly needed a days rest before getting back on it!!
</p><p>
This is SXSW for Europe!!
</p><p>
So whats next.  I suspect it will get bigger next year to be honest.  I hope I am wrong!! 
</p><p>
Personally I beleive there is greater value in smaller, more neiche conferences that startups can attend and actually focus in on who they need to speek with as apose to the shotgun approach the Web Summit demands.  That my 2¢ anyway.
</p><p>
Anyway, I am off to rest up :)

            <p class="blog-post-meta">October 27, 2014 by <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/michaeljdonoghue/">Michael</a></p>
<p>So Monday & Tuesday last week London was host to Techcrunch Disrupt.</P>
<P></P>
First time in London and first time I have had opportunity to attend a Disrupt event! 
</P><P>


Over the two days it looked like there were some great sessions on the MainStage that I would have liked to have caught.  But I missed every single one :)
</P><P>
Startup Alley was were I spent the whole two days.  
</P><P>
The teams came from all over the world to attend and the bar was set pretty high with some great entrepreneurs and companies represented.
</P><P>
I was particularly impressed with a couple of companies I met with, many of whom are heading to Web Summit next week so I intend on catching up with them again.
</P><P>
</P><P>



<P>And congratulations to Crate for winning the battle hack and walking away with the £30,000 cheque.

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">A week in Spain</h2>

<p>So this is really multiple (maybe as many as 3) posts in 1!!  
</p><p>
Barcelona - Whitebull Pathays
</p><p>
Last Monday morning I found myself in Barcelona for the Whitebull Pathways event.  
</p><p>
Things kicked off on the Monday with Bull Pen! This was an afternoon session with “ten” team due to pitch at the full pathways summit intended to supply feedback and help the startups hone their pitch.  Some great mentors gave up their time to work with the startups to hone their pitches and make improvements before the big pitch days later in the week
</p><p>
All in all, Pathways was a pretty small event with only a couple of hundred attendees.  However it was very much focused on getting teams in front of investors. 
</p><p>
Tuesday saw the conference get into full swing.  During the morning sessions we had a couple of talks around selling and investor trends, after which 10 teams had opportunity to pitch their propositions to the entire audience.  Tuesday afternoon there were 1-2-1 sessions between teams and investors which was probably where a vast majority of the value for the teams really lay. 
</p><p>
Unfortunately I missed the final day (was already on my way to Madrid - read on for details) where many of the startups from bull pen pitched bit having spoken to some of the attendees and teams since it sounds like it was a great success.
</p><p>
Well done to the guys at Whitebull for putting on a great event!!  (N.B. I love events that put on food and drink for the attendees).  I will look to check this out again next year.
</p><p>

Madrid - Startup Spain - South Summit
</p><p>
South Summit overal was a great event.  With 100 startups with exhibiting and some really interesting teams.  Over the three days there must have been a couple of thousand attendees which is great too see.  Given the financial and employment distress currently in Spain there was a lot of emphasis on the potential the startup community.
</p><p>
Located in the iconic Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas was pretty unique!  And venue delivered great value for the exhibitors as foot traffic for all booths was very good, due to the layout.
</p><p>
Landing Eric Schmidt to close the event was also a bit of a coup.  Google (and Schmidt) were there to announce the launch of Campus Madrid as one of the next four cities to launch following the success of the flagship London location (I am literally writing this post from inside Campus London :)

<h2 class="blog-post-title">Barclays Techstars Accelerator Demo Day</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">October 1st, 2014 by <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/michaeljdonoghue/">Michael</a></p>
        <p>First thing is first, congratulations to everyone involved in the Barclays Accelerator program that hosted their demo day yesterday.  To all the teams, presenters, organizers, Techstars, and Barclays you did an awesome job.  
</p><p>
Every pitch was expertly delivered and they all knocked it out of the park.  
<br></p>
<p>

However one of the aspects I was most impressed by was the top down buy in that Barclays have in the program, demonstrated by the attendance and intro given by Group Chief Exec, Anthony Jenkins.  As one of (if not the) finance capital of the world I think most people are beginning to recognize the potential London has and the support and hard work and support of the likes of Barclays that can help the ecosystem here reach know heights. 
<br></p><p>
Barclays are really showing other banks (and corporates) up in their engagement with the startup ecosystem… and its great to see.  Time for some of the others to pick up their game methinks...
<br></p><p>

(N.B. I am already looking forward to the next Barclays Techstars cohort!!!)</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">What happens after the Independence vote?</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">September 16, 2014 by <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/michaeljdonoghue/">Michael</a></p>
<p>So this week is a big week for my country.  Now I could go on and on and on about my many concerns, but instead lets focus on one!

</p><p>

This is the biggest political decision faced by the people of Scotland and regardless of the outcome a large section of society is going to feel marginalized.
</p><p>
If you go to Scotland you will see what I mean... </p><p>The Yes voters are pretty vocal and very passionate about the issue and should the vote return a no I hope that the nationalists accept this and do not continue to press the issue.  And having watched with great interest this campaign unfold I have serious concerns about the chances of this.
</p><p>
As concerned about the outcome as I am  (I am very much voting no) there is a worry that whatever the outcome, particularly in the case of a no vote, that the country will remail divided on thie issue.  And then what?</p><p>Never before have I seen a political debate take the country by storm in this way.  Drop in for a quick drink in any Scottish pub and you will see what I mean!
</p><p>With the level of interested will the energy of the debate go away on September 19th, I doubt it.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Why Startups?</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">September 15, 2014 by <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/michaeljdonoghue/">Michael</a></p>
<p>I became invovled in the tech startup world almost immediately following education and have never looked back.
</p><p>
Most recently I spent two months in New York City enrolled in the Startup Institute and I was blown away by the community there.  The openness and welcoming nature that I have always found the USA to be was clear to see and was emphasized here.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.startupinstitute.com" target="_blank">The Startup Institute</a> offered me a platform that aligned with my goals and during my time there was offered a fantastic opportunity to come back to London and work within the community at SoftLayer.  This was an opportunity I could not turn down and I am very excited to become more involved in this, still relatively young, community - one where there is a huge amount of potential.
</p><blockquote><p>
For those interested, there is a great book by Brad Feld, “Startup Communities”, that gives a fantastic overview of how to grow and flourish a successful community that I think is really applicable to the current state here in London.
</p></blockquote><p>
So to answer the title question, the answer is simple… The Community.  It really is a startup life!

<p>Hello and welcome!</p>
            <p>
I have recently had some big life changes and have decided to start this blog as a personal repository and opportunity to share my learnings.
</p><p>
I just relocated my life from my home town, Edinburgh, to London to take up a new role at SoftLayer, offering an opportunity to deep dive into the growing startup community that London has to offer.
</p>            <blockquote>
<p>
This Blog will cover any topic that takes my particular interest on any given week so look forward to some fascinating insights into the world of startups, technology and the community.
